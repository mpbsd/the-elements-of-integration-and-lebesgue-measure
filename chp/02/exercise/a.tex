Show that \([a,b]=\cap_{n=1}^{\infty}(a-1/n,b+1/n)\). Hence any
\(\sigma\)-algebra of subsets of \(\mathbb{R}\) that contains all open intervals
also contains all closed intervals. Similarly,
\((a,b)=\cup_{n+1}^{\infty}[a+1/n,b-1/n]\), so that any \(\sigma\)-algebra
containing all closed intervals also contains all open intervals.
